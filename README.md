# 24HR Wordpress Search Extender
This plugin is extending the admin search (page search) to also include results from `post_content`. We want this feature so we can search for pages with a certain Gutenberg block or WPBakery module. 

## How to install
- Download the plugin from releases. Latest one is [here](https://github.com/marcusthelin/wp-extended-search/archive/v1.0.0.zip).
- Unzip it to the plugins folder.
- Activate.
